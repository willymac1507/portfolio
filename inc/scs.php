                <p>The Scion Coalition Scheme is an intensive, specially tailored training program run by
                    Netmatters
                    in order to give willing candidates the opportunity to enter the industry as web developers.
                    Under the supervision of senior web developers, scions generally aim to complete training
                    within six
                    to nine months. The course is intensive and therefore the level of learning achieved is
